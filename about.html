        <h2>DannyBoy Painting: An HTML, CSS, and Javascript based Website</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>This website includes javascript techniques including variables, taking user input, loops, events, and more.
            Also inlcuded is basic responsive HTML and CSS code. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont">
        <h2>Variables and data types</h2>
        <p>Every piece of Javascript code on this project uses variables and data types. They allow us to manipulate DOM
            elements and create magic. You will see a variety of uses including to take and output information, to
            create and display elements, and much more! The <a href="index.html">Home</a> Page has an example of a
            slider using variables in Javascript</p>
    </div>

    <div id="second" class="cont">
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>An example of function use on this page is in the <a href="services.html">Services</a> Page of the project.
            There you can find the cost estimator which takes input from a user and returns an estimated cost of
            painting their home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont">
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>Loops are very important in Javascript. Our FAQs accordian section uses forEach to loop through each faq
            variable and add an active class to it when it is clicked. You can see it in action on the <a
                href="contact.html">Contact</a> Page.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="third" class="cont">
        <h2>Pop up Window</h2>
        <p>Also included is a pop up window that thanks a user for filling out our form. This pop up Javascript
            functionality is done using global window abject and a separate html page. We use variables to define
            important characteristics like size and an Event Listener to control when we deploy it. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont">
        <h2>Form Validation and Regex</h2>
        <p>Forms are very important in any software as they allow us to capture user information and perform operations
            on that data. In this instance we use a function to provide real-time feedback to the user if the
            information they entered had an incorrect value. You can see this in action on the <a
                href="contact.html">Contact</a> Page.</p>
